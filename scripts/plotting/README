Contents:
    -plot.pl
        - a plotting script with a single sub in it.

Usage:
    To plot contents with this script, you must first 
    do the following things:
        1) drag a copy of plot.pl into your directory (later will be in src)
        2) add 'require "./plot.pl";' to the top of your script.
    To call the sub itself, you must call it like this:
        'plot_data($xlabel, \@xdata, $ylabel, \@ydata, $outputPDFpath);'
        
        !!!IMPORTANT!!!
        DO NOT EXCLUDE THE '\' FROM BEFORE THE 
        ARRAY ARGUMENT.  IT SPECIFIES THAT YOU
        WANT TO SEND IN THE ARRAY, NOT AN ARRAY
        OF DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS.
    Check the output path you gave to find the pdf

Problems:
    Ensure your values are initialized.
    Ensure xdata and ydata arrays are the same length.
